To compile Algencan 4.0.0 first give permissions to the script by typing:

sudo chmod +x install.sh

and then type

./install.sh

============
YOUR PROGRAM
============

(4) You are now ready to compile your main file that calls
algencan. In fact, algencan provides three callable routines:

(a) gencan, for solving unconstrained and bound-constrained problems,

(b) feasgencan, for solving feasibility problem, and

(c) algencan itself, for solving nonlinear programming problems.

Assume that your want to solve a nonlinear programming problem and
that your main program is in a file named algencanma.f90. (If you do
not have your own program yet, you can copy the example in
$ALGENCAN/sources/examples/algencanma.f90. Copy this file to your own
folder.)

First compile your main program with the command:

gfortran -c -O3 -Wall -I$ALGENCAN/sources/algencan/inc algencanma.f90

Then link everything to produce the executable typing:

gfortran algencanma.o -L$ALGENCAN/sources/blas/lib -L$ALGENCAN/sources/hsl/lib \
         -L$ALGENCAN/sources/algencan/lib -lblas -lhsl -lalgencan -o algencanma

Now execute your program typing

./algencanma

Examples of main program that call gencan and feasgencan are missing
and we expect to include them soon. (For now, the calling sequence of
routines gencan and feasgencan can be seen in the CUTEst interfaces in
$ALGENCAN/sources/interfaces/cutest/gencan-forcutest.f90 and
$ALGENCAN/sources/interfaces/cutest/feasgencan-forcutest.f90.)

=============================
SOLVING A PROBLEM FROM CUTEST
=============================

(5) Instead of solving your own problem, you may would like to solve a
problem from the CUTEst collection. Algencan 4.0.0 has three different
interfaces with CUTEst to solve (a) unconstrained and
bound-constrained problems, (b) feasibility problems, and (c)
nonlinear programming problems.

In any case you must first follow Steps 1 to 3 above. Of course, you
need to have CUTEst installed in your computer. You can find it here:
https://github.com/ralna/CUTEst.

Alternative ways exist; and you can find them reading the CUTEst
documentation. We show here how to compile and run Algencan for
solving a CUTEst problem 'by hand'.

Start by setting environment variables related to the CUTEst
installation. For example,

export MASTSIF=$HOME/CUTEst/sif
export ARCHDEFS=$HOME/CUTEst/archdefs
export SIFDECODE=$HOME/CUTEst/sifdecode
export CUTEST=$HOME/CUTEst/cutest
export MYARCH=mac64.osx.gfo

Assume the problem you want to solve is MYPROBLEM.SIF.

Execute the sifdecoder to generate the relevant .f files by typing:

$SIFDECODE/bin/sifdecoder MYPROBLEM.SIF

Sifdecoder will generate the files ELFUN.f, EXTER.f, GROUP.f, and RANGE.f.

Compile them typing:

gfortran -c -O3 ELFUN.f EXTER.f GROUP.f RANGE.f

(a) If the problem is unconstrained or bound-constrained, then you
must use the Algencan main program in
$ALGENCAN/sources/interfaces/cutest/gencanma-forcutest.f90. You must
compile it typing:

gfortran -c -O3 -Wall $ALGENCAN/sources/interfaces/cutest/gencanma-forcutest.f90

And then you link all together with:

gfortran ELFUN.o EXTER.o GROUP.o RANGE.o gencanma-forcutest.o \
            -L$ALGENCAN/sources/blas/lib -lblas \
	    -L$ALGENCAN/sources/hsl/lib -lhsl \
            -L$ALGENCAN/sources/algencan/lib-L$PWD -lalgencan \
            -L$CUTEST/objects/$MYARCH/double -lcutest -o gencanma-forcutest

Finally, run it by typing

./gencanma-forcutest

(b) If the problem is a feasibility problem, i.e., with no objective
function (only equality, inequality, and bound constraints), then
repeat the steps in (a) substituting gencanma-forcutest with
feasgencanma-forcutest everywhere.

(c) If the problem is a nonlinear programming problem, then repeat the
steps in (a) substituting gencanma-forcutest with algencanma-forcutest
everywhere.

=========
MAKEFILES
=========

Typing 'make' in $ALGENCAN generates libraries libblas.a, libhsl.a,
and libalgencan.a. Creating libblas.a is skipped if
$ALGENCAN/sources/blas/lib/libblas.a already exists. Creating libhsl.a
is skipped if $ALGENCAN/sources/hsl/inc/hsl_ma57_double.mod and
$ALGENCAN/sources/hsl/lib/libhsl.a already exist.

Typying 'make clean' in $ALGENCAN removes all compiled and include
files in folders and subfolders, except the libraries in
$ALGENCAN/sources/blas/lib/, $ALGENCAN/sources/hsl/lib/,
$ALGENCAN/sources/algencan/lib/, .mod files in
$ALGENCAN/sources/hsl/inc/ and $ALGENCAN/sources/algencan/inc/, and
binaries.

Typing 'make distclean' in $ALGENCAN does the same as 'make clean'
plus removing the libaries, the .mod files, and the binaries mentioned
in the paragraph above.

Typying 'make example' in $ALGENCAN compiles the main program
$ALGENCAN/sources/examples/algencanma.f90 and generates the executable
$ALGENCAN/bin/examples/algencanma.

Typying 'make cutest PROBNAME=PROB' compiles the corresponding
Algencan's CUTEst interface, depending on whether PROB.SIF is (a) an
unconstrained or bound-constrained problem, (b) a feasibility problem,
or (c) a nonlinear programming problem. The name of the executable
file is gencanma-forcutest, feasgencanma-forcutest, or
algencanma-forcutest in cases (a), (b), and (c), respectively; and it
is located in $ALGENCAN/bin/cutest/.
